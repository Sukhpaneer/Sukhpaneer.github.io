    The Los Angeles Lakers will sign Derrick Williams to a 10-day contract.
Williams averaged 20 points and 6.6 rebounds per game in China this season.
Williams finished last season with the Cavaliers.
With Brandon Ingram out with a groin injury, the Lakers have a need for a playmaker on the wing.

    Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde called the possibility of Neymar's return to his club "a fantasy" after reports published in Spain on Friday said the Brazilian has asked to come back to the Camp Nou, while also linking him to a €400 million move to Real Madrid.
Mundo Deportivo cited unnamed sources as saying that Neymar has sent Barcelona messages about the possibility of a return after leaving the club last summer to sign with Paris Saint-Germain, who paid a world-record transfer fee of €222m to activate his buyout clause.
Meanwhile, AS reported that Barcelona's rivals Real Madrid have already told Neymar's father, who also serves as his manager, that they are willing to pay nearly double that amount and meet PSG's asking price of €400m.
