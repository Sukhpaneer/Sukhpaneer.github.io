      <strong>Vancouver Canucks' standout rookie forward Brock Boeser could be done for the season after suffering a lower back injury Monday night.
      "Brock Boeser will make a full recovery in four to six weeks," said a release from the team.
      "He was taken to hospital last night for further imaging and evaluation where he was diagnosed with a soft tissue injury and a small non-structural, non-displaced fracture of the transverse process in his lower back."</strong></p>
